Counting pumpkins
The folder contains all the files and code which has been developed for this project. 
The WatershedWithClosingOpenPumpkinsBetter.m file is the one used for the RGB program
The WatershedWithHSVPointCloudFilter.m file is the one used for the HSV program. 
The superpixelsExample.m is the one used for the superpixel program. Right no, it os not combined with the watershed transfrom, but uses the code from the WatershedWithClosingOpenPumpkinsBetter.m file. 
The KmeansExample.m is the one used for the k-mean algorithm. Like the superpixel program, it uses some of the code in the WatershedWithClosingOpenPumpkinsBetter-m file i order to split the pumpkin clusters. 

The Functionclass.m is the class file, containing all the used functions for the test. 
The AnalysisClass.m is the class file, containing all the used function for analysing the data. 

The BlockProcessFunc.m is the class file used for the blockprocces function.
The blockprocessTest.m is the program fiel, which uses the BlockProcessFunc.m functions. (the main file for the blockproc program.)
